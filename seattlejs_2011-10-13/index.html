              It wasn't the hardest problem, but it wasn't cake either. Mostly

              so I'll briefly describe a few sticking points.  And then it's
	      open season for questions (or beer, but I'm not paying).

            <p>
              Directory service is a broad term.  Think of it as a key/value
              store, where keys are stored hierarchically.  Oh wait, think of it
              like a file system where the "files" are structured/have a
              schema &#9786;.

            <p>
              Eventually the world figured out X.500 really was a Balrog.  LDAP
              got stood up with a storage engine, and it's been the de facto
	      standard directory service since.

            <p>
              Pretty much everybody has an LDAP for "whitepages".  On top of
              that, lots of folks use it for tracking machines, networks,
              deploys, etc. And then there's ActiveDirectory.

            <h3>LDAP is a stateful protocol</h3>
            <p>
              Unlike HTTP, LDAP is binary on the wire, and connection-oriented.
              That means you need a server framework that can handle loads of
              concurrent connections, and do it at low latency.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="slide">
            <h3>That's in Node's wheelhouse</h3>
            <p>
              Node.js is really good at managing connections. V8 is
              impressively fast (and erlang makes me throw up in my mouth).

          <li class="slide">
            <h3>Paradigm to let you build over anything</h3>
            <p>
              Express is a nice API.  Mimicking that, you end up with an easy to
              embed way of putting LDAP <em>anywhere</em>.

          <li class="slide">
            <h3>Use buffertools</h3>
            <p>
	      The Node buffers API isn't quite at the same level of usability as
	      something like <a href="http://www.jboss.org/netty">Netty</a>. I
	      used <a href="https://github.com/bnoordhuis/node-buffertools">
		buffertools</a> to work around most of it.  There are still
	      cases in ldapjs where I end up copying.
	    </p>
          </li>
          <li class="slide">
            <h3>Message framing is a PITA</h3>
            <p>
	      So LDAP isn't like HTTP where it's easy to stream.  It's possible
	      to write a truly streaming parser, but it's just not worth it
	      (IMO). You really need to drive your stack to test
	      under/over-runs.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="slide">
            <h3>V8 is impressively fast</h3>
            <p>
	      When I started, I wasn't sure if I'd have to do the wire-bits in
	      C++ for performance. There is a big performance gain to doing so
	      (2-3x?), but given LDAP is almost always over something else
	      (slower) that hasn't been the bottleneck.
